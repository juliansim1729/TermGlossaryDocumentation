## Project Updates

To begin with, we were able to merge all of our updates into the [main repository](https://github.com/zjohnson10/final-project-vocab).

### Front-End
Our front-end group got our 'bare-bones' implementation working, and returning the sample responses that we had set up. We also began working to get this functionality working alongside our assets. We are generally happy with how the structure and layout of the page looks, as well as how the functionality and design help to reinforce each other. We now seek to test our front-end code with more varied responses as well as more varied functions rather than the single test we were able to run so far.

### Back-End
We faced some issues regarding planet-scale work and ensuring proper connections, but we were able to get this fixed, and get part of the implemented back-end into GitHub. We were also able to get all of our endpoints started, and made good progress on vocab-term.js, addWord.js, getWord.js, and getWords.js (which is similar in functionality). However, we started to run into issues when we tried to get our database connected to our front-end. This is something we're heavily prioritizing in order to ensure that we are able to test under more realistic scenarios.

### API

We also started the OpenAPI documentation. Utilizing Swagger, we were able to complete our documentation for our vocab term microfrontend. It organizes and allows for us to more easily work with our endpoints.
