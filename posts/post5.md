## Week 11

### Questions
For now, we have no pressing questions.

### Future Steps
In the future, we plan to continue working on front-end assets and achieve a strong balance between functionality and aesthetics. While we have made good progress on assets (as can be seen in the previous blog post), we plan to add in some work regarding text boxes/questions as well as ensure our app is accessible to those with disabilities, poor internet connections, or non-standard devices.

On the back-end perspective, we seek to continue expanding on our frameworks and designs. By documenting how data and information moves within the application, we can more easily make quick edits and implementations. Having documented a sample response as well as two user flow diagrams already, we plan to continue building in a similar vein and ensure we keep working in a well-structured and organized manner.
