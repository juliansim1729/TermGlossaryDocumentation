### General Updates
We mainly focused on getting things ready for the tech demo on Tuesday. We made sure that everything essential was good to go and operable, although we were admittedly a little concerned with the weight the assets might have on the page. However, we are optimistic that things will go well. We also spent some time finishing up some work on our "wishlist" of things to get done. 

### Specific Updates
- We worked a lot on updating our render functions and trying to get the process to work completely, and not just in a relatively limited manner.
- We also updated our OpenAPI to be compatible and up-to-date with all of the changes we have made thus far. We updated our JSON structure a lot as well, reworking our previous design slightly, but it is a design that it is much closer to what we want as an end product.
- Another area of improvement was to the way we search and view terms, removing our sample responses and adding in the functionality for users to play with the app as needed for the demo.

### Questions
- We're not entirely sure whether we have the best way of rendering items outside of a list.
