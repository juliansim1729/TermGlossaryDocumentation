# Week 11

## Progress Made

### Back-End
We started to implement PlanetScale into our back-end databases. We chose to use PlanetScale for its theoretically "infinite" scalability, thus allowing users of our Vocab Glossary to use the app as much as they wish.

We also started to create our user-flow images which help us keep our project well-structured, shown below.

A sample JSON response was also created, [linked here](https://github.com/RajivThummala-psu/TermGlossaryGroupE11ty/blob/main/sample.json).

### Front-End
On the front-end side, we chose to start working through [Adobe Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html) in order to help implement our front-facing design. Dreamweaver is a powerful web dev IDE which enables us to more easily try out different designs to find the best one. 

In addition to this work, we know that having appropriate visuals helps to make the project more cohesive and polished. As such, we spent some time in Adobe Photoshop creating Vocab Glossary visuals to improve the project's aesthetics as part of the front-end design.
