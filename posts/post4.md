Within the scope of this project, many different development tools were utilized. For further information on these tools, please feel free to visit any of the following links.

## [Lit](https://lit.dev/)
Lit is a tool which enables users to build fast and lightweight web components. As every Lit component is a standard web component, Lit elements have the advantage of being natively supported by web browsers and can also be be utilized within any HTML environment. Therefore, Lit was a great and flexible choice for our term glossary app.

## [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
Vercel is a platform that helps to construct front-end frameworks and sites. Most importantly for our project, Vercel allowed for instant deployment, which allowed for rapid testing and prototyping. In addition to this, Vercel boasts automatic scaling for apps focused on larger audiences. Vercel constructed most of the sites within this project, including both the main application and the documentation.

## [HAX](https://haxtheweb.org/haxcms-1)
HAX, or **H**eadless **A**uthoring e**X**perience, is a block editor which works through the power of web components. However, the HAX ecosystem includes powerful tools such as HAXcms, HAX11ty, and WCFactory. While this featuered less heavily within this specific project, it was an excellent way to learn web components.

## [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/)
PlanetScale is a serverless database, which features both incredible scalability and ease of use. It has features such as Data Branching which enables databases to be treated much like code -- this allows for the creation of development and production branches where developers can experiment and modify schema. This tool was utilized for our database within this project.

## [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
Swagger is an API development tool, used particularly within this project to create an OpenAPI 3.0 spec document that enabled us to build the APIs used within this project.

## [Adobe Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html)
AdobeDreamweaver is a front-end tool which simplifies development signficantly, and much like Vercel, allows for instant deployment to experiment and test changes. Although this feature of Vercel was utilized more for back-end and documentation purposes, much of the work on assets and CSS was done through this tool.
