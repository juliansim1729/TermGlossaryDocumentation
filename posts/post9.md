### General Updates
We start this week's updates with some general notes. When we began our project, we used previous projects as templates in order to start with a working basis. Now that we have much more of our functionality implemented, we no longer need to include the previous referential files.

Beginning with general notes, as we began our project using previous projects as templates, we removed all of the unncecessary files from our repositories. We also made sure things were generally spelled out and commented decently for good comprehension when going back.

### Specific Updates
- We realized our PlanetScale database was having errors, but although debugging did take us a while, we were able to fix this problem. In doing so, we also edited our database setup slightly, so we had to go back and make sure our code was still compatible with the database.
- We also updated the render function. We had neglected this for a little bit, so it was a little out of date in terms of what the function needed to be rendering. However, this is still not the final result, as it just contains our sample JSON response for now.
- We started getting everything working together. In particular, a lot of back-end and front-end work began getting properly unified. To do this, we made front-end and back-end both start communicating with addword.js and getword.js.
- We were able to fix some of the visual bugs that were plaguing our front-end design. We're also working on cleaning and bettering the UI.

### Questions
- We're not entirely sure as to how to go about the POST/READ of having the microservice be passed a text string and identify words that match the glossary.
