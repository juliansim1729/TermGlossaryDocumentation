## Description

The term glossary microservice project seeks to present vocabulary based on what a user adds to a page. This draws on previous work which created methods to present vocabulary terms in context of the given material, [linked here](https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/848). Therefore, the project seeks to be able to dynamically store and process vocabulary terms to improve a user's productivity.
